# fullstackproject
First fullstack project: Widgets

Three branches exisit on this project. <br>
Main: contains the read me file explaining the GitHub repository. <br>
Server: contains the server end of the repo and all subsequent files. <br>
  - that is what is contained in this repo
Client: contains the client end of the repo and all subsequent files. <br>
  - This was my first full-stack project I uploaded to GitHub and I didn't realize the client side wouldn't upload when I uploaded the server side. They were in the same view in VS Code, but not the same file. I realize my mistake now, but not when I initially uploaded it. I need to go back and upload the client side of this project.

## Usage

This is a great app to base larger ideas upon! This is the server side only, but again, a great launching pad for similar ideas.
